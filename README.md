# Forecasting-and-Predicting-the-furniture-sales-of-a-superstore using time series analysis 
## Time series analysis
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other 
characteristics of the data
This dataset consists of daily sales data of various products at a 
superstore
## Introduction
You will need to apply Time Series(ARIMA) to build model to 
predict and forecast the sales of furniture for the next one year 
i.e. predict future values based on previously observed values. 
We have a 4-year furniture sales data.
## Evaluation
Evaluation will be based on:
• Data Exploration & Preparation (15%)
• Feature Engineering (20%)
• Model Comparison (30%)
• Model Selection (25%)
• Presentation (10%)
## Data Preparation
Remove unwanted columns that is not needed and check missing 
values. Aggregate sales data by date and finally index it with the 
time series data.
## Feature Engineering
Check the stationarity of the data and decide the next step to be 
taken. Also decompose the data for further clarification
and apply the time series model on the data
## Model Comparison
Perform parameter selection to find optimal set of parameters that 
yields the best performance for the model.
## Model Selection
Compare predicted value to the real values and set the forecast 
from the start to the end of the data

## Problem statement 
We are using Superstore sales data for furniture sales between 2014 to 2017 and apply a simple model to forecast for 2018
